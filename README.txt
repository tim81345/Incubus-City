Every few years, you are struck by a mad compulsion to impregnate. 
At these times you become stronger and your senses become heightened. 
You often wonder at what strange forces have cursed you, but ultimately
you’ve come to accept this strange mission, and even enjoy it.

Breeding season is upon you once again...


WARNING: This game is heinous.
